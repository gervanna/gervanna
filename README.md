## <div align="center"> Hi 👋🏾 </div>



I'm Gervanna (she/her) and I'm a learner in the programming space right now. I haven't figured out where in the tech/code space I fit in just yet; but when I think about what I want to do and where I want to be in the future, I keep coming back to technology. 
- I'm currently learning: Swift and doing the #100DaysOfCode.
- I know basic: HTML and Python.
